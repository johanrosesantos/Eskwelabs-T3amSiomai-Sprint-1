    # AAC can **drive business growth and boost customer satisfaction by:**
    1. Retain high-value RFM customers
        - by offering personalized deals, loyalty rewards, and exclusive experiences

    1. Encourage increased expenditure for other customer segments
        - Special offers and promotions should be positioned to be just above the customer’s current spending habits to encourage them to spend more

    1. Understand age preferences
        - Gen X spends less, Silent generation spends more. Marketing campaigns should be tailored for each group’s preferences
        - Partnerships with Health companies would be helpful for this age demographic

    1. Optimize location, holiday, and time-of-day strategies
        - Since Visayas spends more, resources may be invested more into that region for campaigns and new stores
        - Consider adjusting staffing or promotions during peak holidays and peak time-of-day
    
    1. Expand customer base
        - Targetting more female users would expand the business since females only make up 6% of the current customer base 

    1. Continuous monitoring
        -Stay agile should the market dynamics and consumer preferences change
